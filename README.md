# Portfolio

Project Description

This is my portfolio website, built with React to showcase my web development projects. The goal of the project was to create a clean, responsive, and user-friendly portfolio to highlight my skills, projects, and contact information. And follow a design in Figma.

This site contains:
- Hero section with introduction and profile picture
- Skills section showcasing technologies and tools I know
- Featured Projects highlighting my most relevant projects
- All Projects displaying all projects with details like tags, tools, and descriptions
-Contact section with email and LinkedIn links.

Added project data in data.json including name, image, tags, tools, description, GitHub, and Netlify links.
Styled the site with CSS for a consistent design across screen sizes
Tested locally with npm start and deployed to Netlify. Hade a bit of trouble before learning how to show the site properly with Netlify - all images was hidden in the beginning. Then I found out my src only worked locally. Now it's working in Netlify too. Also got half way with adding metatags for preview when site is linked... but got stuck at putting img in right place and get Netlify to find it.

If I had more time I would have solved problem with divider verical on big sceens. But I think I got how to do it, I just realised it too late and hade to little energy to finish the work. I also want to fix img on projects so text on imgs looks nicer on small screens. On some projects pics is cut a bit quirky.
