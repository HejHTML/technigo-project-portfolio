# Portfolio

Project Description

This is my portfolio website, built with React to showcase my web development projects. The goal of the project was to create a clean, responsive, and user-friendly portfolio to highlight my skills, projects, and contact information. And follow a design in Figma.

Site:
- Hero section with introduction and profile picture
- Skills section showcasing technologies and tools I know
- Featured Projects highlighting my most relevant projects
- All Projects displaying all projects with details like tags, tools, and descriptions
-Contact section with email and LinkedIn links.

Added project data in data.json including name, image, tags, tools, description, GitHub, and Netlify links.
Styled the site with CSS for a consistent design across all screen sizes
Tested locally with npm start and deployed to Netlify. Hade a bit of trouble before learning how to show the site propberly with Netlify - all images was hidden in the beginning. Then I found out my src only worked locally. Now it's working in Netlify too.
